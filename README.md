As currently ChatGPT plugins are invite only, I created a very simple tool to include WolframAlpha for responses for real time data.

1. add environment variable for your ChatGPT API key,
2. register a WolframAlpha App and add its app id as an environment variable too.
3. if you do not have access to the GPT-4 API yet change this line: "model": "gpt-4", #"gpt-3.5-turbo"
